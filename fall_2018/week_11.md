## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have completed the large issue on the ringbuffer class

## This Week's Plan

> I will wait for another issue and try to finish it before the deadline

## Anything Blocking?

> There is nothing blocking me at the current time. 

NOTE: I have commits on another project "Submitty" but it wasn't part of my main assignment so I did not create weekly updates for it.
