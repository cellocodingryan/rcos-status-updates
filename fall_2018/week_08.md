## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I didn't get anything done last week as I had to switch from the pro version of visual studio
to the community version and the project refused to open. The leader of the project has also been unresponsive. Until a few days ago when he responded to my commit with errors that I need to fix.

## This Week's Plan

>I will try to fix the errors without a proper IDE

## Anything Blocking?

> the project won't compile with the community version and that is a problem.
